            <h2>News that lasts.</h2>
            <h3>Schwartz Media publishes intelligent news and current affairs that breaks the 24-hour news cycle. We
                offer a nuanced
                examination of Australia and the world, focused on fresh insight and literary expression. Our audience
                reads to know,
                not just to agree. We invest in long-form journalism where the issues demand it, providing writing of a
                quality that
                makes difficult topics clear. Schwartz Media publishes Australia’s most respected writers across The
                Saturday Paper, The
                Monthly magazine and the daily podcast 7am, alongside our sister publications, Quarterly Essay and
                Australian Foreign
                Affairs.</h3>
